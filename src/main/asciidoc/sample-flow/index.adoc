== Sample Flow

Here one can see how the process of users learning words should work. For such, a flow is presented with the following steps:

. create user _A_;
. authenticate user _A_;
. assign words to user _A_;
. set the first word of user _A_ as learned;
. set the second word of user _A_ as not learned;
. set the third word of user _A_ as learned;
. fetch user _A_ to check the words he lerned;

Starting, user _A_ is created:

.curl sample
include::{snippets}/sample-flow/create-user/curl-request.adoc[]

.request
include::{snippets}/sample-flow/create-user/http-request.adoc[]

.response
include::{snippets}/sample-flow/create-user/http-response.adoc[]

Then, user _A_ is authenticated:

.curl sample
include::{snippets}/sample-flow/login/curl-request.adoc[]

.request
include::{snippets}/sample-flow/login/http-request.adoc[]

.response
include::{snippets}/sample-flow/login/http-response.adoc[]

Now, learning words are assigned to user _A_:

.curl sample
include::{snippets}/sample-flow/assign-words-to-the-user/curl-request.adoc[]

.request
include::{snippets}/sample-flow/assign-words-to-the-user/http-request.adoc[]

.response
include::{snippets}/sample-flow/assign-words-to-the-user/http-response.adoc[]

The learning process starts now, and the first word is learned successfully:

.curl sample
include::{snippets}/sample-flow/learn-first-word/curl-request.adoc[]

.request
include::{snippets}/sample-flow/learn-first-word/http-request.adoc[]

.response
include::{snippets}/sample-flow/learn-first-word/http-response.adoc[]

The second word, however, is not learned, thus the following request is made:

.curl sample
include::{snippets}/sample-flow/do-not-learn-second-word/curl-request.adoc[]

.request
include::{snippets}/sample-flow/do-not-learn-second-word/http-request.adoc[]

.response
include::{snippets}/sample-flow/do-not-learn-second-word/http-response.adoc[]

The third word, fortunately, is learned:

.curl sample
include::{snippets}/sample-flow/learn-third-word/curl-request.adoc[]

.request
include::{snippets}/sample-flow/learn-third-word/http-request.adoc[]

.response
include::{snippets}/sample-flow/learn-third-word/http-response.adoc[]

As a last step, user _A_ is fetched so one can see what are her words' status:

.curl sample
include::{snippets}/sample-flow/fetch-users-with-learning-words/curl-request.adoc[]

.request
include::{snippets}/sample-flow/fetch-users-with-learning-words/http-request.adoc[]

.response
include::{snippets}/sample-flow/fetch-users-with-learning-words/http-response.adoc[]
